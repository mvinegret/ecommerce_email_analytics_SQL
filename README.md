# Ecommerce accounts & email breakdown by country

## Overview
This is an SQL project I did to help identify top 10 countries by # of sent emails and # of accounts created. The whole project was done in **BigQuery** using data from an e-commerce business.

## Data Insights
- This SQL query, combined with the Looker Studio visualization allows us to identify top-10 countries by sent emails and accounts created and adjust marketing budgets accordingly
- The email breakdown allows us to identify email bottlenecks by country and adjust our email marketing strategy for those countries

## Visualization
